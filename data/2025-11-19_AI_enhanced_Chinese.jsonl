In practice, such assumptions frequently break down since airspace sectors operate independently and prioritize local objectives. We address the problem of sector overload in decentralized air traffic management by proposing a mechanism that models self-interested behaviors based on best response dynamics. Each sector adjusts the departure times of flights under its control to reduce its own congestion, without any shared decision making. A tunable cooperativeness factor models the degree to which each sector is willing to reduce overload in other sectors. We prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies a potential game structure, ensuring that best response dynamics converge to a pure Nash equilibrium, under a mild restriction. In addition, we identify a sufficient condition under which an overload-free solution corresponds to a global minimizer of the potential function. Numerical experiments using 24 hours of European flight data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially reduces overload even with only minimal cooperation between sectors, while maintaining scalability and matching the solution quality of centralized solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u822a\u73ed\u8d77\u98de\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u62e5\u5835\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8f7d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5404\u90e8\u95e8\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u4f5c\u4e14\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u672c\u5730\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5047\u8bbe\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u95e8\u8d85\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5404\u90e8\u95e8\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u822a\u73ed\u8d77\u98de\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u8eab\u62e5\u5835\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8c03\u5408\u4f5c\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u90e8\u95e8\u8d85\u8f7d\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5236\u6ee1\u8db3\u6f5c\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u7eaf\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u90e8\u95e8\u95f4\u4ec5\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8f7d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6SpatiaLite\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86SpatiaLite\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cfVLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\uff08IDF\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0VLM\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002IDF\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dVLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7IDF\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals.

Tonguz"], "title": "Quantifying Distribution Shift in Traffic Signal Control with Histogram-Based GEH Distance", "comment": null, "summary": "Traffic signal control algorithms are vulnerable to distribution shift, where performance degrades under traffic conditions that differ from those seen during design or training. This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables.

These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins.", "AI": {"tldr": "FACA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u654f\u6377\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u534f\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u578b\u4eba\u5de5\u52bf\u573a\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7d27\u6025\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u9ad8\u901f\u7a7f\u8d8a\u53d7\u9650\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0cFACA\u65e8\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u654f\u6377\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u534f\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u52bf\u573a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u201c\u73af\u5f62\u201d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFACA\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb3.5\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1170%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "conclusion": "FACA\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u654f\u6377\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eBIM\u5dee\u5f02\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u71b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9759\u6001BIM\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u6709\u9650\u7684\u673a\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u878d\u5408LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u4e0eBIM\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u5730\u9762\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u4e0eBIM\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u60012D\u5360\u636e\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8d70\u5eca\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u89e6\u53d1\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u626b\u63cf\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u91cd\u626b\u63cf\u4f7f\u5e73\u5747\u8d70\u5eca\u98ce\u9669\u964d\u4f4e58%\uff0c\u5730\u56fe\u71b5\u964d\u4f4e43%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e860.4\u7c73\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5c06BIM\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u5efa\u7b51\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Due to the random sparsification that selects only a subset of the state components at each step, we analyze the stability of the closed-loop system in terms of Asymptotic Mean-Square Stability (AMSS), which ensures that the system state converges to zero in the mean-square sense. We consider the problem of designing both a feedback gain matrix and a measurement sparsification strategy that minimizes the number of state components required for feedback, while ensuring AMSS of the closed-loop system. Interestingly, (1) we provide conditions on the dynamics of the system under which it is possible to find a sparsification strategy, and (2) we propose a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) based algorithm that jointly computes a stabilizing gain matrix, and a randomized sparsification strategy that minimizes the expected number of measured state coordinates while preserving the AMSS. Our approach is then extended to the case where the sparsification probabilities vary across the state components. Based on these theoretical findings, we propose an algorithmic procedure to compute the vector of sparsification parameters, along with the corresponding feedback gain matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the stability properties of control systems that rely solely on randomly selected state measurements. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, in some settings, the system achieves comparable performance to full-state feedback while requiring measurements from only $0.3\\%$ of the state coordinates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ea\u80fd\u968f\u673a\u8bbf\u95ee\u72b6\u6001\u5411\u91cf\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cd\u9988\u589e\u76ca\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5747\u65b9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08AMSS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLMI\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u5168\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u80fd\u968f\u673a\u8bbf\u95ee\u90e8\u5206\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08LMI\uff09\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u968f\u673a\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u9700\u6d4b\u91cf0.3%\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5168\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u72b6\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $\u03b2$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5CORGI\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u89c4\u5219\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4RETE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c4\u5219\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9700\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCORGI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff08\u524d\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u5339\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u907f\u514dRETE\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u03b2\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u65b9\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCORGI\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOAR\u548cOPS5\u7684RETE\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "CORGI\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c4\u5219\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions.

FlexiCup supports both vacuum and Bernoulli suction modes through modular mechanical configurations, achieving complete wireless autonomy with onboard computation and power. We validate hardware versatility through dual control paradigms. Modular perception-driven grasping across structured surfaces with varying obstacle densities demonstrates comparable performance between vacuum (90.0% mean success) and Bernoulli (86.7% mean success) modes.

During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM.

However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C).

However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks.

However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb3\u5165\u6cd5\u5411\u548c\u5207\u5411\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u538b\u529b\u548c\u526a\u5207\u5e94\u529b\u6a21\u62df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8212\u9002\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6cd5\u5411\u548c\u5207\u5411\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6750\u6599\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08NMSE\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u4eba\u4f53\u80a2\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise.

While the current methods demonstrate efficacy in small and controlled settings, they face challenges when applied to large-scale and diverse environments, marked by extended periods of exploration and suboptimal paths of discovery. In this paper, we propose MA-SLAM, a Map-Aware Active SLAM system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), designed to address the challenge of efficient exploration in large-scale environments. In pursuit of this objective, we put forward a novel structured map representation. By discretizing the spatial data and integrating the boundary points and the historical trajectory, the structured map succinctly and effectively encapsulates the visited regions, thereby serving as input for the deep reinforcement learning based decision module. Instead of sequentially predicting the next action step within the decision module, we have implemented an advanced global planner to optimize the exploration path by leveraging long-range target points.

This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7531\u6559\u5e08\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5fae\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u8bca\u65ad\u7cbe\u51c6\u4f46\u5e72\u9884\u8584\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bca\u65ad\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5e72\u9884\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u65f6\u673a\u4e0d\u5f53\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u63d0\u5347\u5e72\u9884\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5145\u5206\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ed\u5408\u4fdd\u969c\u3001\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u914d\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u503c\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u7a97\u53e3\u7b49\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u7406\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff081204\u540d\u5b66\u751f\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u5168\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u95ed\u5408\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u6559\u5b66\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bfe\u5802\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoETTA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Mixture-of-Experts\u67b6\u6784\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MoE\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0cMoETTA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MoETTA\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware lightweight monocular SLAM system combining sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction.

Their implementation requires qubits to operate at cryogenic temperatures (CT) while control and readout electronics typically still remains at room temperature (RT). As systems scale to millions of qubits, the electronics should also operate at CT to avoid a wiring bottleneck. However, wired power transfer from RT for such electronics introduces severe challenges, including thermal load between cooling stages, Joule heating, noise coupling, and wiring scalability. This paper addresses those challenges by evaluating several candidate architectures for scalable power transfer in the dilution frige: high-voltage (HV) wired power transfer, radiative wireless transfer, non-radiative wireless transfer, and a hybrid HV and non-radiative transfer. These architectures are analyzed in terms of thermal load, power loss, heating, coupling noise, power density, scalability, reliability, and complexity. Comparative analysis demonstrates the trade-offs among these architectures, while highlighting HV non-radiative transfer as a promising candidate for scalable quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u7a00\u91ca\u51b0\u7bb1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u529f\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u51e0\u79cd\u5019\u9009\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u70ed\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u529f\u7387\u635f\u8017\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u538b\u975e\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5ba4\u6e29\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6e29\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u6750\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u70ed\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u529f\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5019\u9009\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u9ad8\u538b\u6709\u7ebf\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u975e\u8f90\u5c04\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u538b\u4e0e\u975e\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u70ed\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u529f\u7387\u635f\u8017\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u538b\u975e\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u5728\u70ed\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u529f\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u538b\u975e\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u529f\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u56e0\u5728\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u56e0\uff09\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u5374\u5f88\u5c11\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u56e0\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u57fa\u56e0\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout.

Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.\n  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions.

Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0e\u7535\u7f51\u4e92\u8054\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u5171\u632f(SSR)\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9891\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u963b\u6297\u5efa\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9884\u9632\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u8fd0\u884c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7535\u7f51\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u5bf9\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u5171\u632f(SSR)\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bbe\u5907\u635f\u574f\u6216\u7ea7\u8054\u6545\u969c\u3002\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9891\u626b\u63cf\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u963b\u6297\u7279\u6027(\u5e45\u503c\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u89d2\u968f\u9891\u7387\u53d8\u5316)\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u963b\u6297\u5efa\u6a21\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30SSR\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u963b\u6297\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u9632\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u963b\u6297\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u963b\u6297\u4e0b\u964d\u5e76\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u548c\u9884\u9632\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u88d5\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7535\u7f51\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9884\u9632SSR\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5e76\u7f51\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training.

Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCCoL\u7684\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49-\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49-\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u514b\u9686\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u6267\u884c\u95f4\u65ad\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CCoL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u5957\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0cCCoL\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4e868.0%\uff0c\u5728\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d2\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u4e8619.2%\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e5f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CCoL\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49-\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

A 2.2 MWh, 1.1 MW Tesla battery, emulating operations at the University of Queensland's St. Lucia campus, is used as a test system. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) frameworks rely on deterministic spot price forecasts from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to optimize battery scheduling. However, these forecasts lack uncertainty awareness, making arbitrage strategies vulnerable to extreme price volatility. To address this, we propose simple heuristic uncertainty discounting methods, which require no access to the predictive model's architecture or inputs. By integrating these strategies into existing MPC frameworks, we demonstrate a more than 20% improvement in economic returns under identical operational constraints.

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark.

Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u964d\u4f4e\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\uff08DE\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u7528\u96c6\u5408\u84b8\u998f\uff08CED\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578bCREDIT\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002CREDIT\u9884\u6d4b\u7c7b\u95f4\u6982\u7387\u533a\u95f4\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u7528\u96c6\u5408\u84b8\u998f\uff08CED\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578bCREDIT\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7c7b\u95f4\u6982\u7387\u533a\u95f4\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCED\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "CED\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.", "AI": {"tldr": "MSDP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\uff09\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u6f14\u5458\u548c\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u97006000\u6b21\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MSDP\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks.

Ensuring the reliability of the software controlling these systems is therefore critical. Mutation testing, a technique widely used in software engineering, evaluates the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small faults, or mutants, into the code. However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection.

Previous power-flow and soft-open-point solutions are bulky and expensive. They need transformers and large magnetics, some on grid frequency, others more compact at high frequency. Even suggested circuits with high-frequency transformers still struggle with cost and size. We present a compact partial power-conversion high-current full-power-flow control circuit without a single transformer. We combine silicon and silicon-carbide, each with their specific advantages for current-dense direct injection. The circuit further needs fewer semiconductors than previous concepts. The circuit links a shunt converter through a non-isolated inverter bidirectionally with low-voltage series modules that practically float with their respective phases can serve between different feeders in low-voltage power grids.

We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps.

Yet, translating these advantages into endoscopic interventions within open cavities remains challenging. The lack of anatomical constraints and the inherent flexibility of such devices complicate their control, while the limited field of view of endoscopes restricts situational awareness. We present a robotic platform designed to overcome these challenges and demonstrate its potential in fetoscopic laser coagulation, a complex MIS procedure typically performed only by highly experienced surgeons.

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08ALA\uff09\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08KD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6216\u8f6c\u5f55\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528ALA\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5757\u8868\u793a\u30022. \u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807KD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u97f3\u9891\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5e72\u51c0\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ALA\u548cKD\u4e3a\u6539\u5584Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.\n  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations.

The resulting visual obstructions impair firefighting accuracy, further compounded by inaccurate assessments of the fire's location. Such imprecision simultaneously increases the overall damage and prolongs the fire-brigades operation unnecessarily.\n  We propose an automated assistance system for firefighting using a motorized fire monitor on a turntable ladder with aerial support from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach.

This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users.

This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models.

Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance.

This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "PathMind\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f15\u5bfcLLMs\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LLM-based\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u9700\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\uff08KGR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u76f2\u76ee\u63d0\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5bfc\u81f4\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u8c03\u7528LLMs\u3002", "method": "PathMind\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u68c0\u7d22-\u4f18\u5148\u5316-\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u68c0\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u5b50\u56fe\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u51fd\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPathMind\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u8f83\u5c11\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "PathMind\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8650%\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "DAS\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8349\u7a3f\u5668\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u7f00\u6811\uff09\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u8349\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDAS\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe50%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "DAS\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, existing perception modules, mainly based on depth images or elevation maps, offer only partial and locally flattened views of the environment, failing to capture the full 3D structure. This paper presents Gallant, a voxel-grid-based framework for humanoid locomotion and local navigation in 3D constrained terrains. It leverages voxelized LiDAR data as a lightweight and structured perceptual representation, and employs a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this representation to the control policy, enabling fully end-to-end optimization. A high-fidelity LiDAR simulation that dynamically generates realistic observations is developed to support scalable, LiDAR-based training and ensure sim-to-real consistency. Experimental results show that Gallant's broader perceptual coverage facilitates the use of a single policy that goes beyond the limitations of previous methods confined to ground-level obstacles, extending to lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages.

Complementarily, data collected online can contribute to improving the feedback performance relative to the current system's conditions, but are unable to account for the overall -- possibly time-varying -- system operation.\n  With this in mind, we consider the problem of stabilizing a time-varying linear system, whose parameters are only known to lie within a bounded polytopic set. Taking a robust data-driven approach, we synthesize the control law by simultaneously leveraging two sets of historical state and input measures: an offline dataset -- which covers the extreme variations of the system parameters -- and an online dataset consisting of a rolling window of the latest state and input samples.\n  Our approach relies on the data informativity framework: we thus relax persistent excitation requirements (i.e., the collected samples need not be sufficient for system identification), while still allowing for the design of a stabilizing controller. The state feedback law is obtained from standard Lyapunov arguments, implemented via semi-definite optimization: this also yields an upper bound on the cost-to-go for the class of systems that are consistent with the online data, while guaranteeing a decreasing cost for all systems compatible with the offline data.

Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates.

In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models.

This paper addresses this problem by replacing the conventional outer PI controllers that regulate DC-link and PCC voltages with an offset-free data-driven predictive controller. The developed algorithm leverages either pre-fault or fault-time data to construct input-output predictors, yielding offset-free control without the need for physics-based modelling. Simulation results show that pre-fault offset-free DPC doubles the critical equivalent grid impedance that can be handled and reduces the root mean squared error during faults by a factor of 40, while maintaining computation times comparable to conventional PI control. These findings demonstrate that the developed offset-free data predictive controller offers a simple, robust, and computationally efficient alternative to conventional control, significantly enhancing fault-ride-through capabilities of converters in weak grids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u504f\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684PI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5f31\u7535\u7f51\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u6545\u969c\u7a7f\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u5f31\u7535\u7f51\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u54cd\u5e94\u632f\u8361\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u504f\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6545\u969c\u524d\u6216\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u5c06\u4e34\u754c\u7b49\u6548\u7535\u7f51\u963b\u6297\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e40\u500d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfPI\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u504f\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f31\u7535\u7f51\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6545\u969c\u7a7f\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions.

This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization.

We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\\%/90\\%/88\\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\\,ms.

Smith"], "title": "Rate-Distortion Guided Knowledge Graph Construction from Lecture Notes Using Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport", "comment": "Accepted in the 5th Workshop on Knowledge Graphs and Big Data in Conjunction with IEEE Big Data 2025", "summary": "Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness.

We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \\leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance.

To address this fundamental issue, we propose a stratospheric energy grid in which wireless power transfer (WPT) interconnections constitute the grid layer, while HAPs operate as dynamically reconfigurable integrated generation-grid-load-storage (IGGLS) nodes that harvest, buffer, consume, and peer-to-peer transfer energy for constellation-level balancing and resilience. In this system, each HAP node can flexibly switch among energy source, load, and storage roles according to its energy status and mission requirements, enabling energy exchange and spatiotemporal optimization within the stratosphere. Through cooperative scheduling, the stratospheric grid not only enables surplus-to-deficit energy support among HAPs but also extends upward to satellites and downward to the terrestrial grid and communication infrastructure, forming a heterogeneous, WPT-mediated interconnection. As an IGGLS ecosystem, it exploits peer-to-peer energy logistics, spatiotemporal smoothing of intermittency, cross-domain backup via the terrestrial grid, and service-aware dispatch, thereby boosting overall energy utilization and operational resilience.

However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes.

However, its lossless, reactive power-agnostic model often yields dispatches that are infeasible under practical operating scenarios such as the nonlinear AC power flow (ACPF) equations. While theoretical analysis demonstrates that DCOPF solutions are inherently AC-infeasible, their widespread industry adoption suggests substantial practical utility. This paper develops a unified DCOPF-ACPF pipeline to recover AC feasible solutions from DCOPF-based dispatches. The pipeline uses four DCOPF variants and applies AC feasibility recovery using both distributed slack allocation and PV/PQ switching. The main objective is to identify the most effective pipeline for restoring AC feasibility. Evaluation across over 10,000 dispatch scenarios on various test cases demonstrates that the structured ACPF model yields solutions that satisfy both the ACPF equations, and all engineering inequality constraints. In a 13,659 bus case, the mean absolute error and cost differences between DCOPF and ACOPF are reduced by 75% and 93%, respectively, compared to conventional single slack bus methods. Under extreme loading conditions, the pipeline reduces inequality constraint violations by a factor of 3 to 5.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684DCOPF-ACPF\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4eceDCOPF\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u6062\u590dAC\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AC\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "DCOPF\u56e0\u5176\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5ffd\u7565\u635f\u8017\u548c\u65e0\u529f\u529f\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u79cdDCOPF\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u677e\u5f1b\u5206\u914d\u548cPV/PQ\u5207\u6362\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u6062\u590dAC\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d41\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AC\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u8fdd\u89c4\u51cf\u5c113\u81f35\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u6d41\u7a0b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DCOPF\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution.

Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models.

Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels.

While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates.

To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation.

While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.\n  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path.

Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training.

The need for answering such \"when-if\" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts.

Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u504f\u89c1\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534720%\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u51cf\u8f7bLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5176\u4f20\u64ad\u6709\u5bb3\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u89c1\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982StereoSet\u548cCrowSPairs\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u504f\u89c1\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u663e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe20%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u5b9a\u6210\u6548\uff0c\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25\u00b0 spatial resolution.

Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories.

Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets.

Chamon"], "title": "Learning with Statistical Equality Constraints", "comment": "to be published in the 39th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems", "summary": "As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints.

However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks.

We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems.

However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5REST\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u5230\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u5f0f\u5230\u8fbe\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5728\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u504f\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684REST\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u516c\u5171\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u768420\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cREST\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "REST\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u548c\u8c10\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU.

However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ecePPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u5fc3\u810f\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u76d1\u6d4b\u5728\u7cbe\u51c6\u5065\u5eb7\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u5fc3\u810f\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff08\u5982\u6bcf\u640f\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\u548c\u5fc3\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u52a8\u8109\u538b\u529b\u6ce2\u5f62\uff09\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5149\u7535\u5bb9\u79ef\u63cf\u8bb0\uff08PPG\uff09\u5728\u533b\u9662\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c4\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u4ecd\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u6210\u5bf9PPG-APW\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6a21\u62dfAPW\u6bb5\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ecePPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fc3\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\u548c\u6bcf\u640f\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u76d1\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u810f\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{PAFM}, a \\textbf{P}erturbation-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{F}low \\textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%.

This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.\n  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.\n  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods.

Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a Warping Index (WI) \u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u5230 2D \u5e73\u9762\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7a7a\u767d\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u5f02\u5e38\u6216\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u826f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6295\u5f71\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Warping Index (WI)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7a7a\u767d\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "WI \u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u626d\u66f2\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u964d\u7ef4\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "WI \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReflexGrad\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u56e0\u679c\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u5c42\u7ea7\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728ALFWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b067%\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e92\u8865\u673a\u5236\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Most existing models adopt either \\textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \\textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{E}nhancer (\\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{F}orecaster (\\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.", "AI": {"tldr": "Adapformer\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u9053\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u901a\u9053\u72ec\u7acb\u548c\u901a\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u901a\u9053\u72ec\u7acb\u6216\u901a\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u5ffd\u7565\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u591a\u566a\u58f0\u3002Adapformer\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u9053\u589e\u5f3a\u5668\uff08ACE\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u9053\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff08ACF\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "Adapformer\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Adapformer\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u9053\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}
