While notions like differential privacy have been successfully introduced to dynamical systems, it is still unclear how a system's privacy can be properly protected when facing the challenging yet frequently-encountered scenario where an adversary possesses prior knowledge, e.g., the steady state, of the system. This paper presents a new systematic approach to protect the privacy of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system against adversaries knowledgeable of the system's prior information. We employ a tailored \\emph{pointwise maximal leakage (PML) privacy} criterion. PML characterizes the worst-case privacy performance, which is sharply different from that of the better-known mutual-information privacy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PML privacy and construct tractable design procedures. Furthermore, our analysis leads to insight into how PML privacy, differential privacy, and mutual-information privacy are related. We then revisit Kalman filters from the perspective of PML privacy and derive a lower bound on the steady-state estimation-error covariance in terms of the PML parameters. Finally, the derived results are illustrated in a case study of privacy protection for distributed sensing in smart buildings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u5bf9\u624b\u62e5\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u6001\uff09\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u70b9\u6700\u5927\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff08PML\uff09\u9690\u79c1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u9690\u79c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u62e5\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u6001\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u70b9\u6700\u5927\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff08PML\uff09\u9690\u79c1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5176\u5fc5\u8981\u548c\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86PML\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecePML\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86PML\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PML\u9690\u79c1\u6807\u51c6\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u62e5\u6709\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor (MEF), average emission factor (AEF), and day-ahead market (DAM) prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7528\u7535\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6210\u672c\u53ca\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u4ef7\u4e0e\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u4ef7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ca\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7528\u7535\u589e\u957f\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u53ca\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u7535\u4ef7\u4e0e\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u6392\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7535\u4ef7\u4e0e\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u4ef7\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9009\u5740\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u4ef7\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u963b\u788d\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Computational models of DBS are widely used to investigate the effects of stimulation on neural tissue, to explore stimulation targets and sweetspots, and ultimately, to aid clinicians in the DBS programming by calculating the stimulation parameters. Commonly, DBS is performed bilaterally, i.e. with one lead in each brain hemisphere, where computational models are solved independently for one lead at a time. This paper treats scenarios where multiple DBS leads are implanted in close proximity to one another, resulting in interacting electrical fields and, therefore, potentially overlapping stimulation spreads. In particular, a global dual-lead model is compared to approximations derived from single-lead approaches in a cohort of twelve multiple sclerosis (MS) tremor patients. It is concluded that simple superposition of volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) underestimates activation, while superposition of electric fields or activating functions leads to overestimation. It is concluded that given close proximity of DBS leads, the VTA cannot be computed individually as stimulation fields exhibit significant and complex interaction. The approach is extended to modeling two obsessive compulsive disorder patients with medially placed leads, where similar VTA discrepancies as in the MS patient cohort are observed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u90e8\u8111\u523a\u6fc0\uff08DBS\uff09\u5e38\u7528\u5355\u4fa7\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u7535\u6781\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u690d\u5165\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4e\u4f30\u6216\u9ad8\u4f30\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u7535\u6781DBS\u4e2d\u7535\u573a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u533a\u57df\uff08VTA\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u72ec\u7acb\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5168\u5c40\u53cc\u7535\u6781\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5355\u7535\u6781\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u679012\u4f8b\u591a\u53d1\u6027\u786c\u5316\u9707\u98a4\u60a3\u8005\u7684VTA\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u7535\u6781\u53e0\u52a0\u6cd5\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u6216\u9ad8\u4f30\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u7535\u6781\u9700\u8003\u8651\u7535\u573a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7535\u6781DBS\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u72ec\u7acb\u751f\u6210VTA\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies.

For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -\u03a3 p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials).

Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u964d\u9636\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u6210\u5f62\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\u6210\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210POD\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u7ef4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7RLS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528MPC\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u8f6e\u677f\u6750\u6210\u5f62\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($\u03c1$) and head-tail ratio ($\u03b7$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6LT-Soups\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u5448\u73b0\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5c3e\u90e8\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u5934\u90e8\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u5934\u5c3e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faLT-Soups\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5e73\u8861\u5b50\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u5e76\u5e73\u5747\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5934\u90e8\u7c7b\u522b\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5934\u90e8\u7c7b\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLT-Soups\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8ePEFT\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LT-Soups\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u5934\u90e8\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives.

However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems.

Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability. The results demonstrate that the morphing leg offers a promising path toward SAR robots that can both navigate terrain quickly and perform rescue tasks effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u4f38\u7f29\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u817f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u641c\u6551\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5730\u5f62\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u641c\u6551\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e2\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5f62\u53c8\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u9ad8\u529b\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u867d\u5730\u5f62\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u7684\u4e94\u6746\u8fde\u6746\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u4f18\u52bf\u914d\u7f6e\u4e4b\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8fde\u6746\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5f62\u817f\u5728\u6b65\u957f\u3001\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u641c\u6551\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u641c\u6551\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u5730\u5f62\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6551\u63f4\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions.

Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual.

Based on prior work in simple orbits, our method produces a broad class of stable, periodic trajectories by stabilizing the system around a Lie group-based geometric embedding. Employing the Lie group SO(3), we generate a wider range of periodic curves than existing quaternion-based methods. Furthermore, we exploit SO(3) properties to eliminate the need for velocity inputs, allowing agents to receive only position inputs.

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u201d\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u4e09\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u6f14\u7ece\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u3001\u6eaf\u56e0\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5143\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u672a\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, traditional FIM assessment imposes a significant burden on both patients and healthcare professionals. To address this challenge, we propose an automated FIM score estimation method that utilizes simple exercises different from the designated FIM assessment actions. Our approach employs a deep neural network architecture integrating a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor item scores. The model effectively captures long-term temporal dependencies and identifies key body-joint contributions through learned attention weights. We evaluated our method in a study of 277 rehabilitation patients, focusing on FIM transfer and locomotion items. Our approach successfully distinguishes between completely independent patients and those requiring assistance, achieving balanced accuracies of 70.09-78.79 % across different FIM items.

However, monitoring is still often performed manually due to the lack of suitable algorithmic methods and data.

The simulator is fully parameter-driven, adaptable to other wastewater stations, and capable of generating datasets for data-driven analytics. It can also generate balanced faulty datasets when real failures are scarce or confidential. A comparison with high-frequency SCADA data from a municipal station shows strong agreement across key operational metrics. Furthermore, the paper proposes robust statistical and mathematical frameworks for fault detection and isolation, including a nested-model F-test to detect pump degradation or system faults, and a tangent residual approach to distinguish pump faults from system faults using operating-point kinematics.

Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple.

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings.

This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u6811\u6839\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\u5177\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u96be\u8fdb\u5165\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u951a\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6869\u57fa\u951a\u5b9a\u9700\u8981\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u53d6\u963b\u529b\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5165\u6216\u5916\u661f\u573a\u5730\u3002\u6811\u6839\u63d2\u5165\u673a\u5236\u5219\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u7075\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u951a\u5b9a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6869\u57fa\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51c6\u5219\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u7684300\u514b\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee5\u5c0f\u4e8e\u81ea\u91cd\u7684\u529b\u63d2\u5165\u677e\u6563\u706b\u661f\u571f\u58e4\u6a21\u62df\u7269\uff0c\u951a\u5b9a\u529b\u8fbe120 N\uff0c\u951a\u5b9a\u91cd\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e3a40:1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u951a\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens.

To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system. It efficiently converts human hand manipulation sequences from demonstration videos into high-quality dexterous manipulation trajectories without requirements of massive training data. To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can automatically generate smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions, achieving high efficiency and strong generalizability with an average transfer success rate of 73%, providing an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u624b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u96c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5339\u914d\u7684\u521d\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u62c7\u6307\u5f15\u5bfc\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fdd\u7559\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8155\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8f6c\u79fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe73%\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u6536\u96c6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Most existing studies evaluate these algorithms under the assumption of homogeneous platoons, i.e., when all platoon members adopt the same CACC. However, market competition is likely to result in vehicles from different manufacturers implementing distinct CACCs. This raises fundamental questions about whether heterogeneous vehicles can safely cooperate within a platoon and what performance can be achieved. To date, these questions have received little attention, as heterogeneous platoons are difficult to model and analyze. In this work, we introduce the concept of mixed platoons, i.e., platoons made of vehicles running heterogeneous CACCs, and we study their performance through simulation-based experiments. We consider mixtures of three well-established CACCs from the literature. In the first part of the paper, we study a single mixed platoon in isolation to understand the microscopic effects on safety: we evaluate the performance of various CACC-mixtures across speed change and emergency braking scenarios. In the second part, we examine a high-density ring-road scenario to assess macroscopic impacts on safety, comfort, and traffic throughput, especially comparing throughput results with those obtained from vehicles controlled by a standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or by human drivers. Our findings highlight that some combinations of CACCs can operate robustly and safely, while others exhibit critical limitations in safety, comfort, or efficiency. These results emphasize the need for careful system design and the development of theoretical frameworks for modeling heterogeneous platoons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u534f\u540c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5de1\u822a\u63a7\u5236\uff08CACC\uff09\u7f16\u961f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cCACC\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e02\u573a\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u53ef\u80fd\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684CACC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u7f16\u961f\u80fd\u5426\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\u53ca\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7591\u95ee\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdCACC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5fae\u89c2\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u4ea4\u901a\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u67d0\u4e9bCACC\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8212\u9002\u6027\u6216\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6784\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u5e76\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8111\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u961f\u5217\u7684tau-PET\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data.

In contrast, world models that capture environmental dynamics in latent space have opened up new perspectives for navigation tasks, enabling systems to move beyond traditional multi-module pipelines. However, world model often suffers from high computational costs in both training and inference. To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL. The key idea is that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation. Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency. By incorporating an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy during training, the model effectively captures long-term spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby enhancing navigation performance in complex scenarios.

While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08\u5982\u65e5\u672c\u300a\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u300b\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6cd5\u89c4\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4e1a\u52a1\u80cc\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u534f\u8bae\u534f\u8c03\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728200\u4e2a\u300a\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u300b\u4fee\u8ba2\u6848\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u523072%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad821\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5408\u89c4\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523090%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6cd5\u5f8bAI\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Reddy"], "title": "SURFACEBENCH: Can Self-Evolving LLMs Find the Equations of 3D Scientific Surfaces?", "comment": null, "summary": "Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench", "AI": {"tldr": "SurfaceBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u66f2\u9762\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b183\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u7b26\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u516c\u5f0f\u6216\u7b80\u5316\u529f\u80fd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SurfaceBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b183\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8986\u76d615\u7c7b\u7b26\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Chamfer\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u66f2\u9762\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "SurfaceBench\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u5f52\u7eb3\u548cLLM\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations.

While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u533a\u5206\u5916\u5728\u548c\u5185\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u533a\u5206\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u533a\u5206\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5916\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5185\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5185\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u662f\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m. These experiment results show that our humanoid robot can deliver highly dynamic while precise goal striking in badminton, and can be adapted to more dynamism critical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7fbd\u6bdb\u7403\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u6b65\u6cd5\uff0c\u518d\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7403\u62cd\u6325\u52a8\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08EKF\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u7fbd\u6bdb\u7403\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fde\u7eed\u51fb\u740321\u6b21\uff1b\u73b0\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u51fb\u7403\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523010 m/s\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8fd4\u56de\u843d\u70b9\u8ddd\u79bb3.5\u7c73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7fbd\u6bdb\u7403\u51fb\u7403\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u901a\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations.

Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures.

The objects that we manipulate, salmon loins, are natural in origin and vary in size and shape, they are limp and deformable with poorly characterized elastoplastic parameters, while also being slippery and hard to hold. The three robots straighten the loin; grasp and hold the knife; cut with the knife in a slicing motion while cooperatively stabilizing the loin during cutting; and pick up the thin slices from the cutting board or knife blade. Our system combines deep reinforcement learning with in-hand tool shape manipulation, in-hand tool cutting, and feedback of visual and tactile information to achieve robustness to the variabilities inherent in this task.

Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth.

In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u826f\u597d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5c06\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7528\u4e8e\u6536\u96c6\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences.

To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence.

Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data.

To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration.

While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability.

Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive.

Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation.

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision.

However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \\textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance.

Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method.

However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin.

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience.

This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks.

However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system.

Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08UDA\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86URDA\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5DART\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08VAT\uff09\u5728UDA\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4e09\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1aVAT\u5728UDA\u4e2d\u5931\u6548\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u7b80\u5355\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faURDA\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793aUDA+VAT\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1DART\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\u4e24\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDART\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86URDA\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7DART\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits.

While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGuR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u79ef\u7d2f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5143\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6574\u5408\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEGuR\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe14%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e111\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "EGuR\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method.

To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention.

The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u77ed\u671f\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CNN-ConvLSTM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u56db\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f4eRMSE\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7xAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eERA5\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u4f18\u5316\u5377\u79ef\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u7684RMSE\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\uff1a\u73ed\u52a0\u7f57\u5c140.21 mm/\u5929\uff0c\u5b5f\u4e700.52 mm/\u5929\uff0c\u5fb7\u91cc0.48 mm/\u5929\uff0c\u52a0\u5c14\u5404\u7b541.80 mm/\u5929\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08xAI\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u7684\u964d\u6c34\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants.

We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2.

While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.\n  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "RETROFIT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4ef2\u88c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u65b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002RETROFIT\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4ef2\u88c1\u65e7\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cRETROFIT\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "RETROFIT\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u89e3\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u504f\u89c1\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u5219\u662f\u4f4e\u504f\u89c1\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6311\u6218\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5728ETTm1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3a\u96f6\uff1b\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u53ef\u7528\u4e00\u6b65\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u9012\u5f52\u6216\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u504f\u89c1-\u65b9\u5dee\u76f4\u89c9\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks.

Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u6307\u5357\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0cEHR\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528All of Us\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d865,000\u591a\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684EHR\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u548c\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30EHR\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u764c\u75c7\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "EHR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u4f8b\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u7d20\u9ad83-6\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u5148\u8fdb\u7684EHR\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e8626\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EHR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u7684\u529b\u573a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u78c1\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eLMFP\u6750\u6599\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\uff08MLFFs\uff09\u5728\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u78c1\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728LMFP\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u529b\u573a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6MLFF\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3aMLFFs\u5728\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08MeZO\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\uff08MeZO\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f30\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMeZO\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "MeZO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6743\u8861\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.\n  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\\mathcal C$ and any predictor $\u03b3$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\\hat \u03b3$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\\hat \u03b3$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $\u03b3$.

However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption.

Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group.

As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \\emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.\n  In this work, we generalize the study of the \\emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].\n  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \\emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al.

However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.
