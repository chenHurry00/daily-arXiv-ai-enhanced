We propose a method for detecting goal changes by tracking multiple candidate action sequences and verifying their plausibility against a policy bank. Upon detecting a change, the robot refines its belief in relevant past actions and constructs Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) trees to actively select actions that assist the human while encouraging Differentiating Actions to reveal their updated goal.

Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency.

We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling.

However, obtaining full trajectories across networks is costly, and accurately inferring lane-changing (LC) and car-following behaviors in multi-lane environments remains challenging. This study proposes a generative framework for arterial vehicle trajectory reconstruction that jointly models lane-changing and car-following behaviors through physics-informed multi-task joint learning. The framework consists of a Lane-Change Generative Adversarial Network (LC-GAN) and a Trajectory-GAN. The LC-GAN models stochastic LC behavior from historical trajectories while considering physical conditions of arterial intersections, such as signal control, geometric configuration, and interactions with surrounding vehicles. The Trajectory-GAN then incorporates LC information from the LC-GAN with initial trajectories generated from physics-based car-following models, refining them in a data-driven manner to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions. The proposed framework is designed to reconstruct complete trajectories from only a small subset of connected vehicle (CV) trajectories; for example, even a single observed trajectory per lane, by incorporating partial trajectory information into the generative process. A multi-task joint learning facilitates synergistic interaction between the LC-GAN and Trajectory-GAN, allowing each component to serves as both auxiliary supervision and a physical condition for the other. Validation using two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates that the framework outperforms conventional benchmark models in reconstructing complete time-space diagrams for multi-lane arterial intersections.

This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery.

In this paper, we identify and address the gap in modeling spatial dependence among component failures under extreme weather. We analyze how the mean, variance, and correlation structure of weather intensity random variables influence the correlation of component failures. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially dependent sampling method that enables joint sampling of multiple component failures by generating correlated meteorological intensity random variables. Comparative studies show that our approach captures long-tailed scenarios and reveals more extreme events than conventional methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of scenario selection on preventive control performance. Our key findings are: (1) Strong spatial correlations in uncertain weather intensity consistently lead to interdependent component failures, regardless of mean value level; (2) The proposed method uncovers more high-severity scenarios that are missed by independent sampling; (3) Preventive control requires balancing load curtailment and over-generation costs under different scenario severities; (4) Ignoring failure correlations results in underestimating risk from high-severity events, undermining the robustness of preventive control strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy.

The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators.

Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks.

However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning.

Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control.

Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem.

Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching.

This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a \"naive\" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as \"Instability Poisoning,\" where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses \"Late Fusion\" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types.

By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of \"exploration collapse\", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes.

Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side.

PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers.

To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings.

Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting.

Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss.

Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models.

We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence. Three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms are presented to satisfy the application requirements of various network updates.

While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power.

ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability.

In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees.

With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.
